To top everything this ball has magic powers and the ability to fulfill all of your interrogations.

When you question the crystal ball directly it emits a multicolored light according your voice, and once you have finished asking your question and the silence restored, the ball goes from darkness to light before answering.

The answer can always be read, because the magical spherical shape moves around inside the crystal ball as though it were under the influence of a gravitation pull within. You may move your device as you wish, its gyrometer sensor does the rest.

This answer may be affirmative:
* Yes
* It is certain
* Timely yes
* Without a doubt
* Yes it is obvious
* Yes definitely
* You may rely on it
* Most likely
* It is decidedly so
* Outlook good
* I guess so

Or negative:
* Very likely
* Stop dreaming
* Don't count on it
* Certainly not
* My sources say no
* Very doubtful
* Not at all

But sometimes capricious, this ball can also provides you a noncommittal answer as:
* I don't know
* No idea
* Try later
* Cannot predict now
* Better not ask

**NB:** However note that the answer does not match with the truth but is the result of a pseudo random algorithm called "Mersenne Twister".
